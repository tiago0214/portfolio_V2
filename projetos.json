Features such as add to bag, favorite were implemented to give a real experience of saving products on the platform.Those features store data in local storage to prevent the user from losing their products if something happens. When something is added to a bag or favorite, it shows a popup to make it easier for the user to know what's happening. I implemented a carousel to show the products on the home page, to give a better experience.",
